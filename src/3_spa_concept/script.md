### Todo's

- PWA's?
    - Quasi das beste von Web Apps und Nativ Apps vereint.
    - Discoverable, so the contents can be found through search engines.
    - Installable, so it can be available on the device's home screen or app launcher.
    - Linkable, so you can share it by sending a URL.
    - Network independent, so it works offline or with a poor network connection.
    - Progressively enhanced, so it's still usable on a basic level on older browsers, but fully-functional on the latest ones.
    - Re-engageable, so it's able to send notifications whenever there's new content available.
    - Responsively designed, so it's usable on any device with a screen and a browserâ€”mobile phones, tablets, laptops, TVs, refrigerators, etc.
    - Secure, so the connections between the user, the app, and your server are secured against any third parties trying to get access to sensitive data.
